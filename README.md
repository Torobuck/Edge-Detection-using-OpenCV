# 🔍 Edge Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time **edge detection** using the **Canny algorithm** in Python, powered by OpenCV.

## 📽️ Demo Video

A .mp4 demonstration video is included to visually showcase the project in action.  

Also it's just for reference - you don’t need to run it. (Unless you want to hear my voice and if so, be my guest.)

## 🛠️ Features

- Loads and processes video frames from webcam or file
- Applies **Canny Edge Detection**
- Displays both original and processed output
- Runs in real-time with adjustable thresholds (optional)

## 💻 Requirements

- Python 3.13 (or compatible)
- OpenCV (opencv-python)
- NumPy

## 📦 Installation

bash
pip install opencv-python numpy


## To Launch

- Open up CMD
- Type python EdgeDetection.py
